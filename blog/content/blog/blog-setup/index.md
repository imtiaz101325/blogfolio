# A simple start

I had delayed writing a blog for a long time because I wanted to make it perfect. The time never came where I got around to doing that. So for this blog I decided to just start something and let it grow.

I had my eyes on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for a long time. And I love the idea of using Markdown to write my blog posts. Which is why it only felt natural for me to use their [official starter blog boilerplate](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) to get up and running. You can start your own blog this way by following [their tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/). I did not change anything apart from the configuration for now. I am hoping to add more features incrementally in the future.

Since the content is mostly static I am going to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy my blog. For now I would like to keep things simple this way.
