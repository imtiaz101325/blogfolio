&lt;p&gt;I had delayed writing a blog for a long time because I wanted to make it perfect. The time never came where I got around to doing that. So for this blog I decided to just start something and let it grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my eyes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. And I love the idea of using Markdown to write my blog posts. Which is why it only felt natural for me to use their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/&quot;&gt;official starter blog boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; to get up and running. You can start your own blog this way by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/&quot;&gt;their tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. I did not change anything apart from the configuration for now. I am hoping to add more features incrementally in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the content is mostly static I am going to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; to deploy my blog. For now I would like to keep things simple this way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is my first blog post.

I have not written in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not hate writing. But I guess I have been suffering from a prolonged writer’s block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am back!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
