The time never came where I got around to doing that. So for this blog I decided to just start something and let it grow.</p>\n<p>I had my eyes on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a> for a long time. And I love the idea of using Markdown to write my blog posts. Which is why it only felt natural for me to use their <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/\">official starter blog boilerplate</a> to get up and running. You can start your own blog this way by following <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/\">their tutorials</a>. I did not change anything apart from the configuration for now. I am hoping to add more features incrementally in the future.</p>\n<p>Since the content is mostly static I am going to use <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> to deploy my blog. For now I would like to keep things simple this way.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Blog Setup","date":"May 08, 2020","description":"How I have setup my blog."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog-setup/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}}}}}
